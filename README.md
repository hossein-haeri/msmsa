Multi-Scalar Model Stability Analysis (MSMSA) is an adaptive in-stream learning solution designed to detect and counteract concept drift in real-time data streams. The algorithm utilizes anchor points to measure drift consistently and employs Allan Variance to detect variances between model predictions.
