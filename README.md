# msmsa
Multi-Scalar Model Stability Analysis (MSMSA) is an adaptive in-stream learning solution designed to detect and counteract concept drift in real-time data streams. The algorithm utilizes anchor points to measure drift consistently and employs Allan Variance to detect variances between model predictions.



The MSMSA (abbreviation not defined in provided code) repository is dedicated to in-stream learning, particularly addressing challenges introduced by the phenomenon known as "concept drift." Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of the target variable change, which can degrade the performance of machine learning models.

Features:

- Robust Handling of Concept Drift: The core class MSMSA encapsulates the behavior and methods required to detect and adapt to changes in the underlying data distribution.
- Dynamic Memory Management: The algorithm maintains a memory of the last n samples and uses various horizons to retrain the model based on changes in the data.
- Anchor Point Evaluation: To measure the drift, the model is evaluated across various anchor points, generated randomly, which allows for consistent drift measurement.
- Allan Variance Calculation: This statistical measure is employed to detect changes in the variance between different model predictions, aiding in understanding the concept drift.
- Dynamic Validity Horizon: Based on the model performance and detected drift, the validity horizon dynamically adjusts, determining how many previous data points should be used to train the model.


Usage:

Instantiate the MSMSA class with desired parameters, add samples to the algorithm using the add_sample method, and periodically call the update_ function to refresh the underlying model based on detected drift.
